# Chapter 2: Majoritarian or Pluralist Democracy?

## 2.1 - The Theory of Democratic Government

Ancient Greeks catagcaized government by size of involvement:

<u>**Autocracy**</u>: A system of government in which the power to govern is concentrated in the hands of one individual.  
<u>**Oligarchy**</u>: A system of government in which power is concentrated in the hands of a few people.  
<u>**Democracy**</u>: A system of government in which, in theory, the people rule, either directly or indirectly.

### The Procedural View of Democracy

<u>**Procedural democratic theory**</u>: A view of democracy as being embodied in a decision-making process that involves universal participation, political equality, majority rule, and responsiveness.

Procedural view looks to answer 3 questions:

1. Who should participate in decision making?
2. How much should each participant's vote count?
3. How many votes are needed to reach a decision?

<u>**Universal Participation**</u>: The concept that everyone in a democracy should participate in governmental decision making.  
<u>**Political Equality**</u>: Equality in political decision making: one vote per person, with all votes counted equally.

<u>**Representative Democracy**</u>: A system of government where citizens elect public officials to govern on their behalf.
