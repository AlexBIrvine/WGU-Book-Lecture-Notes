# Chapter 1: Freedom, Order, or Equality?

## 1.1 - The Globalization of American Government

<u>**Government**</u>: The legitimate use of force to control human behavior; also, the organization or agency authorized to exercise that force.  
<u>**National Sovereignty**</u>: A political entity's externally recognized right to exercise final authority over its affairs.

Globalization is having more of an impact in today's world than it has in the past.  
More and more nations are policing each other and having impact on other countries.

## 1.2 - The Purposes of Government

### 1) Maintaining Order

<u>**Order**</u>: Established ways of social behavior.

<u>**Liberalism**</u>: The belief that states should leave individuals free to follow their individual pursuits.

<u>**Communism**</u>: A political system in which, in theory, ownership of all land and productive facilities is in the hands of the people, and all goods are equally shared. The production and distribution of goods are controlled by an authoritarian government.

People discussed in this section:

- Thomas Hobbes
- John Locke
- Karl Marx

### 2) Providing Public Goods

<u>**Public Goods**</u>: Benefits and services, such as parks and sanitation, that benefit all citizens but are not likely to be produced voluntarily by individuals.

Examples of public goods:

### 3) Promoting Equality

Equality can be either economically or socially enforced.  
Welfare systems = economic.  
Laws (like gay marriage) = social.

### Totalitarianism

<u>**Totalitarianism**</u>: political philosophy that advocates unlimited power for the government to enable it to control all sectors of society.

The object is to produce a perfect society serving some master plan for “the common good.”

### Socialism

<u>**Socialism**</u>: A form of rule in which the central government plays a strong role in regulating existing private industry and directing the economy, although it does allow some private ownership of productive capacity.

<u>**Democratic Socialism**</u>: A socialist form of government that guarantees civil liberties such as freedom of speech and religion. Citizens determine the extent of government activity through free elections and competitive political parties.

Socialism pertains the government's role in the economy.  
Government would control industry (goods & services).  
Socialism isn't fully communism since it only heavily regulates private industry, not private goods.

### Capitalism

### Libertarianism

<u>**Libertarianism**</u>: A political ideology that is opposed to all government action except as necessary to protect life and property.

<u>**Laissez Faire**</u>: An economic doctrine that opposes any form of government intervention in business.

### Anarchism

<u>**Anarchism**</u>: A political philosophy that opposes government in any form.
