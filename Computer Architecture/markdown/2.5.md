# 2.5 Technologies for building processors and memory

## General terms:

<u>**Transistor**</u>: An on/off switch controlled by an electric signal.  
<u>**Very large-scale integrated (VLSI)**</u>: A device containing hundreds of thousands to millions of transistors.

<u>**Silicon**</u>: A natural element that is a semiconductor.  
<u>**Semiconductor**</u>: A substance that does not conduct electricity well (only partially lets electrons through).

<u>**Silicon crystal ingot**</u>: A rod composed of a silicon crystal.  
<u>**Wafer**</u>: A slice from a silicon ingot used to create chips.  
<u>**Die**</u>: The individual rectangular sections that are cut from a wafer.  
<u>**Yield**</u>: The percentage of good dies from the total number of dies on the wafer.

## Chip manufacturing process:

1. Silicon ignots are gathered and sliced to make wafers.
2. Wafers are put through 20~40 processing steps to make patterned wafers.
3. Patterned wafers are tested and a map of good/bad parts is created.
4. Wafers are then sliced into dies.
5. Good dies are bonded into packaged dies.
6. Packaged dies are tested one last time and ship if good.
