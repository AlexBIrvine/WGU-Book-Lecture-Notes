# 3.7 Instructions for making decisions

## Branching

<u>**CBZ Instruction**</u>: The instruction will goto the label L1 if the value in the register is zero.  
CBZ register, L1

<u>**CBNZ Instruction**</u>: The instruction will goto the label L1 if the value in the register is _NOT_ zero.  
CBNZ register, L1

<u>**B Instruction**</u>: The instuction will goto the label EXIT.  
B Exit

## Looping

Looping in LEGv8 relies on creating a Loop: label that points to a CBZ/CBNZ instuction. At the end of the loop body, B Loop is called.

## Conditionals

| Comparison | Instruction |
| :--------: | :---------: |
|     =      |    B.EQ     |
|     !=     |    B.NE     |
|     <      |    B.LT     |
|     <=     |    B.LE     |
|     >      |    B.GT     |
|     >=     |    B.GE     |

Conditional code is held in 4 bits.  
In the MIPS instructions set, two registers are compared and then branches based on result.
