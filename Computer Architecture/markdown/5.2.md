# 5.2 Logic design conventions

<u>**Combinational element**</u>: An operational element, such as an AND gate or an ALU.  
This only depends on the present input value.  
<u>**State element (sequential element)**</u>: A memory element, such as a register or a memory.

<u>**Clocking methodology**</u>: The approach used to determine when data is valid and stable relative to the clock.  
<u>**Edge-triggered clocking**</u>: A clocking scheme in which all state changes occur on a clock edge.  
<u>**Control signal**</u>: A signal used for multiplexor selection or for directing the operation of a functional unit; contrasts with a data signal, which contains information that is operated on by a functional unit.

<u>**Asserted**</u>: The signal is logically high or true.  
<u>**Deasserted**</u>: The signal is logically low or false.
