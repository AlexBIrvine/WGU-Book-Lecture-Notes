# 3.11 Parallelism and instructions: synchronization

If a program relies on values generated by another thread, then there needs to be a synchronization mechanism in place to ensure the data is correct.

Useful quote:  
"In LEGv8 this pair of instructions includes a special load called a load exclusive register (LDXR) and a special store called a store exclusive register (STXR). These instructions are used in sequence: if the contents of the memory location specified by the load exclusive are changed before the store exclusive to the same address occurs, then the store exclusive fails and does not write the value to memory"

<u>**Data race**</u>: Two memory accesses form a data race if they are from different threads to same location, at least one is a write, and they occur one after another.
