# 4.2 Addition and subtraction

Addition & Subtraction is completed just like it is in decimal, from right to left.  

**Overflow** will occur when the last bit (leftmost bit) changes due to the addition/subtraction operation.  
This is because in two's complement, the sign has changed.  

<u>**Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**</u>: Hardware that performs addition, subtraction, and usually logical operations such as AND and OR.
