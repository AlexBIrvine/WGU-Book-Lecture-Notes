# 2.11 Concluding remarks

**In summary:**

- The most reliable method to evaluate performance is execution time.
- Software developers need an understanding of hardware to write efficient programs.
- Energy efficiency is the most critical resource of microprocessor design.
- Power limitations have forced computer designers to exploit parallelism to improve system performance.

**Reliable Method for Reporting Performance:**  
$$\frac{Seconds}{Program} = \frac{Instructions}{Program} * \frac{Clock Cycles}{Instuctions} * \frac{Seconds}{Clock Cycle}$$
