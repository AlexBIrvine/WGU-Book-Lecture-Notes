# 2.9 Real stuff: Benchmarking the Intel Core i7

## Section terms:

<u>**Workload**</u>: A set of programs run on a computer that is either the actual collection of applications run by a user or constructed from real programs to approximate such a mix.  
<u>**Benchmark**</u>: A program selected for use in comparing computer performance.  
<u>**SPEC (System Performance Evaluation Cooperative)**</u>: An effort supported by multiple vendors to create a standard set of benchmarks.

**SPEC** runs <u>12 benchmarks</u> as of the **SPEC SPU2006** standard:

|  #  | Description                       | Name       |
| :-: | :-------------------------------- | :--------- |
|  1  | Interpreted string processing     | perl       |
|  2  | Block-sorting compression         | bzip2      |
|  3  | GNU C compiler                    | gcc        |
|  4  | Combinatorial optimization        | mcf        |
|  5  | Go game (AI)                      | go         |
|  6  | Search gene sequence              | hmmer      |
|  7  | Chess game (AI)                   | sjeng      |
|  8  | Quantum computer simulation       | libquantum |
| 19  | Video compression                 | h264avc    |
| 10  | Discrete event simulation library | omnetpp    |
| 12  | Games/path finding                | astar      |
| 12  | XML parsing                       | xalancbmk  |

Each benchmark runs with varying requirements, number of instructions, and loads.  
SPEC now has a power benchmark in addition to the CPU efficiency benchmark.
