# 3.10 LEGv8 addressing for wide immediates and addresses

The LEGv8 instruction set includes the instruction **move wide with zeros (MOVZ)** and **move wide with keep (MOVK)** specifically to set any 16 bits of a constant in a register.

<u>**PC-relative addressing**</u>: An addressing regime in which the address is the sum of the program counter (PC) and a constant in the instruction.

## LEGv8 addressing mode summary

<u>**Immediate addressing**</u>: The operand is a constant within the instruction itself.  
<u>**Register addressing**</u>: The operand is a register.  
<u>**Base addressing / displacement addressing**</u>: The operand is at the memory location whose address is the sum of a register and a constant in the instruction.  
<u>**PC-relative addressing**</u>: The branch address is the sum of the PC and a constant in the instruction.

<u>**Addressing mode**</u>: One of several addressing regimes delimited by their varied use of operands and/or addresses.
