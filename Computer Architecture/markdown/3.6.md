## 3.6 Logical operations

## Types of logical operations:

1. OR
2. AND
3. NOT
4. EOR (Exclusive OR)

AND can be used to mask out particular bits (forcing those bits to 0's)  
OR can be used to set particular bits to 1  
An AND operation can isolate a field in a doubleword.  
A shift left followed by a shift right operation can isolate a field in a doubleword.
