# 2.3 Below your program

This lesson gives an explanation on how your high level program (say python/C/Java) is controlled by the OS, gets compiled then assembled, and what these lower level terms are.

### Terms from this lesson:

<u>**Systems software**:</u> Software that provides services that are commonly useful, including operating systems, compilers, loaders, and assemblers.  
<u>**Operating system**:</u> Supervising program that manages the resources of a computer for the benefit of the programs that run on that computer.  
<u>**Compiler**:</u> A program that translates high-level language statements into assembly language statements.  
<u>**Binary digit (or bit)**:</u> One of the two numbers in base 2 (0 or 1) that are the components of information.  
<u>**Instruction**:</u> A command that computer hardware understands and obeys.  
<u>**Assembler**</u>: A program that translates a symbolic version of instructions into the binary version.  
<u>**Assembly language**</u>: A symbolic representation of machine instructions.  
<u>**Machine language**</u>: A binary representation of machine instructions.  
<u>**High-level programming language**</u>: A portable language such as C, C++, Java, or Visual Basic that is composed of words and algebraic notation that can be translated by a compiler into assembly language.
