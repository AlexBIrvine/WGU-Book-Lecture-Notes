# 3.9 Communicating with people

Numbers can be converted into text with the ASCII table.  
LDURB != LDUR.

- LDURB gets just the one byte at location 5000. LDUR would get the eight bytes at locations 5000, 5001, 5002, 5003, 5004, 5005, 5006, and 5007, and combine those bytes into a 64-bit doubleword

Java requires 16 bits for strings, C only requires 8 bits. This is because Java supports more characters for non-english languages.  
Strings in C use null (0) to mark the end of a string.  
Strings in Java reserve the first position of the string to specify the string length.

- Since this is the case, string operations such as determining length are trivial and can be faster in Java than in C.
