# 2.8 The sea change: The switch from uniprocessors to multiprocessors

From the mid 1980's to early 2000's, CPU performance rose about 52%/year.  
This slowed around 2002~2004 due to the power wall explained in the previous chapter.  
After the power wall was hit, CPU manufactures switched to a multicore design.

This change has forced programmers to start thinking parallel over serial to take advantage of the multiple cores.  
The best way to do this is to divide a program into subtasks and run them together so they finish in about the same time.

Increasing the number of cores increases the complexity/difficulty of programming in parallel.
