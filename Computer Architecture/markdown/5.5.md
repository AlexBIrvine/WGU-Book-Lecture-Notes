# 5.5 An overview of pipelining

<u>**Pipelining**</u>: An implementation technique in which multiple instructions are overlapped in execution, much like an assembly line.

Formula for pipeline execution time:

## Pipeline Hazards

<u>**Structural Hazard**</u>: When a planned instruction cannot execute in the proper clock cycle because the hardware does not support the combination of instructions that are set to execute.  
<u>**Data Hazard**</u>: When a planned instruction cannot execute in the proper clock cycle because data that is needed to execute the instruction are not yet available.

Example:  
When the following two instructions are next to each other, a data hazard exists.  
ADD X19, X0, X1  
SUB X2, X19, X3

<u>**Load-use data hazard**</u>: A specific form of data hazard in which the data being loaded by a load instruction has not yet become available when it is needed by another instruction.

<u>**Control Hazard (Branch Hazard)**</u>: When the proper instruction cannot execute in the proper pipeline clock cycle because the instruction that was fetched is not the one that is needed; that is, the flow of instruction addresses is not what the pipeline expected. This is from the need to make a decision based on the results of one instruction while others are executing.

## Hazard Resolution Techniques

<u>**Forwarding (bypassing)**</u>: A method of resolving a data hazard by retrieving the missing data element from internal buffers rather than waiting for it to arrive from programmer-visible registers or memory.  
<u>**Pipeline stall (bubble)**</u>: A stall initiated in order to resolve a hazard.

Forwarding resolves some data hazards. Reordering resolves some others.  
If neither can resolve a data hazard, a stall may become necessary.

<u>**Branch Prediction**</u>:  A method of resolving a branch hazard that assumes a given outcome for the conditional branch and proceeds from that assumption rather than waiting to ascertain the actual outcome.
