# 2.7 The power wall

Clock rate and power consumption are directly proportional to each other.

The Intel Pentium 4 prescott CPU (the one you built with "hyper threading technology") was the last CPU to really increase processor frequency.  
This CPU saw frequent thermal issues (you know, this was the first computer you built) and the industry moved to multicore for improvements.

## Formula's for the section:

1. $Energy = Capacitive$ $load$ x $Voltage^2$
2. $Power = k$ x $Voltage^2$ x $Frequency$

## Useful example problems
