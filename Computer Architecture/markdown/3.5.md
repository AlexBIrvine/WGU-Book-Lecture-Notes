# 3.5 Representing instructions in the computer

<u>**Field**</u>: A machine instruction is composed of many fields, which are fixed width amount of bits.  
<u>**Instruction format**</u>: A form of representation of an instruction composed of fields of binary numbers.  
<u>**Machine language**</u>: Binary representation used for communication within a computer system.

Binary is more commonly written in hexadecimal since it shortens the length of characters needed.  
4 digits in binary = 1 digit in hexadecimal.

<div style="text-align : center; font-weight: bold;">LEGv8 Fields for R type instructions</div>

| opcode  |   Rm   | shamt  |   Rn   |   Rd   |
| :-----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| 11 bits | 5 bits | 6 bits | 5 bits | 5 bits |

<u>**opcode**</u>: Basic operation of the instruction (add).  
<u>**Rm**</u>: The second register source operand.  
<u>**shamt**</u>: Shift ammount.  
<u>**Rn**</u>: The first register source operand.  
<u>**Rd**</u>: The register destination operand. It gets the result of the operation.

### Design Principle 3: Good design demands good compromises.

## Types of LEGv8 Instructions:

<u>**R-Type**</u>: These include ADD & SUB.  
They are instructions that do not have immediate values and do not deal with pulling from memory addresses.

<u>**I-Type**</u>: These include any instruction that deals with immediate values (like ADDI & SUBI).

<u>**D-Type**</u>: Deals with working with memory.  
Examples include LDUR & STUR.
