## 4.13 - Counting multisets

**Set** - A collection of *distinct* items.  
**Multiset** - a collection that can have multiple instances of the same kind of item.  

Formula for counting a multiset:  
$\binom{n+m-1}{m-1} = \frac{(n+m-1)!}{(m-1)!n!}$  
Where n objects and m varieties (12 cookies, 4 possible flavors)
