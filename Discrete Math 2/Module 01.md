# Module 1 - Algorithm Structures

## 1.3 - Introduction to algorithms

3 Basic building blocks of algorithms:
1. **Assignments** - Gives values to variables.  
2. **Conditional Statements** - Direct flow of steps.  
3. **Loops** - Allow steps to be repeated.  

--- 

## 1.4 - If-then algorithms

 **IF-statement** - Tests a condition, and executes one or more instructions if the condition evaluates to true.

 ---

## 1.5 - For-loop algorithm

**Iteration** - A process where a set of instructions or structures are repeated in a sequence a specified number of times or until a condition is met.

---

## 1.6 - While-loop algorithm

**While-loop** - A process that iterates an unknown number of times, ending when a certain condition becomes false.

---

## 1.7 - Nested loop algorithm

**Nested loop** - When a loop is placed inside another loop.
