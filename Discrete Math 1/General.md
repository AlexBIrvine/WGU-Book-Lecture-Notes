I need to get this down in writing, and I don't want to do this over journal due to wanting to type on these PBT keycaps.

I like these keycaps, please forgive my current obsession.

Discrete math is currently making me very nervous. It's gotten to the point where there are 3 distinct sections that I just don't get right away, and it's giving me a headache just looking at them. The three sections are:

1. Linear algebra properties / later sections of chapter 4.
2. Steps, edges, etc., for relations in chapter 6.
3. Partial and strict orders in chapter 6.

2 & 3 above could be just me feeling too full to think, and too stressed to pay attention. This chair I'm sitting in at work seriously sucks ass. It's sucking the joy out of my ass, and making me tired just existing in it. Also, I'm feeling like I'm 'wasting' my time learning this as it's not giving me a single application for how to use any of this. Pure theory at this point, and I KNOW that there is many uses for this subject applicable to what I want to do. It's discouraging to be honest.

It also doesn't help that there are many things that I want to do that will help me learn computer stuffs, but I feel if I touch that it's just fancy procrastination. What I should really be doing (instead of writing this out for example) is burying my head in the discrete math book. Only I wrestle with that decision, since what is my goal for finishing school if not to get into the field of programming? If I don't program, how is that REALLY helping me? Should have translates to won't do because I'm paralyzed by wanting to be optimal. That's a really stupid thing for my brain to conclude and act out. I hate it for that, let's override that decision.

Pomodoro blocks, although they have gotten me to sit down and do work, seem like they are getting in the way these days. I don't know why, but 30 minutes then a full stop to walk makes me have to cold stop my brain engine and start it up again. Starting friction is the hardest to overcome afterall. I think combining a free form writing such as this, along with actual book notes will be the best solution.

Also, why do I like writing things down on paper when I often turn to keyboard typing when super stressed? It's a chore to keep my handwriting calm, inefficient as far as word count, and scratching out bad words that I want to correct never feels good. Should I swtich back to a typed journal? Will that make things better?

Honestly, fuck it. Why am I'm constantly concerned with what is better? Good enough seems great compared to the stress needed for better. Optimizing for stress/energy might be the more human way. Leave better up to the machines I'll build later.

But I won't build them later if I don't start on them now. I'm a fool.

::sigh::

Discrete math is the current huddle. If I can't get the basics of this down, I won't be able to get into the advanced stuff that matters later. Let's fix that. I'm going to get a glass of water, put back on my headphones, and start writing out a summary of each section of the class so far. After that if I have time (I'll have the time damn it) I'll work on setting up an outline for both my "quantifed self" spreadsheet I've been talking about and the learning/project blog I've been talking about. Work starts after the break:

---

## Module 1 - Logic and Proofs

This section defined many terms (Proposition), introduced the operators AND, OR, XOR, NOT & truth tables. Truth tables will have as many rows as 2^n, where n is the number of variables. Lastly it gave us the order of operations for logic, and two more symbols (-> for "therefore" and <-> for [if and only if]).

## Module 2 - Propositional Statements

Think applied module 1, with the introduction of properties. A lot was defined in this module (Proposition, converse, contrapositive, inverse, biconditional operation, tautology, contradiction, De Morgan's Law, and 10 other Laws). This will be a heavy memorization module when it comes to study time.

## Module 3 - Quantifiers

Basic propositional/logic statements where in the last module, this one adds modifiers on top of it. "There exists an x where..." "For all of x... / for every x..." are examples for existential quantfiers and universal quantifiers respectively. More laws/properties are then stated based on these.

## Module 4 - Logic of Proofs

Now let's use the past 3 modules to do some work! We now use the previous lessons and apply them to arguments, which consists of one or more hypothoses and a conclusion. Shortly after introducing it, we determine if it's valid/invalid and shortcuts/properties to make life easier.

## Module 5 - Foundations of Proofs

Proof by (blank). This is applying the previous lesson into very distinct examples of different kinds of proofs. This will probably be the test materials.

## Module 6 - Working with sets

Welcome to chapter 2: set theory. Sets are a collection of unordered elements, simple as that. They can contain anything (numbers, variables, really anything) and don't technically have to make sense on why they are together. Throw an iron, apple, the concept of fairness and Gary Coleman into a box and you have a physical representation of a set.

A finite set doesn't go on forever, an infinite set does. A null set has nothing in it, and set cardinality is how many elements are in the set.

Sets are written with comma seperated elements in curly braces, it's cardinality surrounded by "pipes".

A = {iron, apple, concept of fairness, Gary Coleman} |A| = 4

Sets builder notation, subsets and proper subsets are also introduced. (I really should learn LaTex to write this out)

Power sets are a set of all subsets for a current set.  
So A={1, 2, 3}
P(A)={nullSET, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}}

Venn diagrams where then shown, with intersections and unions. Difference and symetric difference as well. Set laws at the end like every good module.

## Module 7 - Higher set operations

Hello (ordered, pairs)! Really that's about it. That and explaining disjoint and partitions.

## Module 8 - Overview of functions

Set functions are... fun. Rounding (floor and ceiling) have their own notation I can't type out, and 3 important terms are introduced (injective, surjective, and bijective)

**Injective** - One to one. Elements in a set match to only one element in another set.  
**Surjective** - Onto. Not sure why it's called onto. It pretty much means that for every element in set Y, it will be 'pointed to' by an element in set X. If one or more don't get pointed to, it's not surjective.  
**Bijective** - Both injective and surjective. Simple.

Invertible functions exist only when it's Bijective. That's why it's explained above.

## Module 9 - Function composition and applications

You can have compsition of funcions. I didn't take many notes on this, so it must have confused me or was trivially easy. I should have taken notes.

## Module 10 - Boolean algebra

Chapter 3 has arrived. It's like chapter 1, but with math instead of words. Booleans refer to values in the set {0, 1}, or on/off, or 1 and 0. You can multiply (logic AND), add (logic OR), complement (logic NOT), or also do an exclusive or (logic XOR). Logic tables were reintroduced, and even more laws were introduced.

## Module 11 - Normal forms and Functional completeness.

Disjunctive normal forms and Conjunctive normal forms.

(Wishing I had LaTex knowledge so I can write this out. Might learn that next).

Example of Disjuctive normal form (DNF) = $\bar{x}y\bar{z} + xy$

Example of Conjunctive normal form (CNF) = $(\bar{x} + y + \bar{z})(x+y)$

NOR and NAND are also introduced.

## Module 12 - Boolean Satisfiability, Gates, Circuits

Halfway point of the class! Boolean Satisfiability = "Can an expression evaluate to 1?"

It then introduces logic gates symbols and has a TON of practice interpreting them.

## Module 13 - Matrix Additions & Multiplication

Chapter 4, Linear algebra. This is my weakest section, and something I'll need to practice.  
Not sure how to type this out with LaTex yet...

## Module 14 - Guassian Elimination & Matrix Inversion

I don't even know... I bought a book to understand this better, so hopefully I'll take the time to read and learn that. Crossing fingers that the test doesn't really have a ton of these questions.

## Module 15 - Overview of Sequences

Chapter 5 felt... pointless. A sequence is an ordered set. They increase with either a **Geometric sequence** or an **Arithmetic sequence**. The former by a common factor (time each number by 6 for example), the latter by a constant amount (add 3 to each number).

## Module 16 - Sequences & Series

Summation/Sigma notation was introduced for both finite and infinite sequences. You can find out what the infinite sequence is converging to by finding it's limit, or determine it's a diverent using the divergence test.

## Module 17 - Binary relations & directed graphs

Chapter 6, intro to graph theory??? It never says, but I have a hunch it is. This chapter introduces some confusing looking diagrams that become easy once you know what you're looking at. It also marries every single thing fro
m previous sections into one big item!

---

My notes dropped off here, it's hard to draw out I guess and keep up with it? I think it might also just be stupid stress from perceived gravity of the subject. ::sigh:: There are a few sections that obviously are diffucult for me, but overall I have this down. I can get the concepts for the most part, and the few things that are really confusing I can still look up in other resources.

Either way, I just learned how to incorperate LaTex and Markdown together, so my notes can be moved over to digital form.

I'm going to take a walk and then close out my 3 tickets for tonight.
FUCK, third shift for the other team! Forgot since I have to work out of two sheets. ....
