# Module 22 - Paths and Cycles in Trees

## 7.11 - Introduction to trees

**Tree** - Undirected connected graph that has no cycles.  
**Free tree** - A tree with no particular organization.  
**Rooted tree** - A tree that "stems" from a root vertex.  
**Vertex Level** - Distance from root.  
**Height of Tree** - Highest level of tree (root vertex = 0 level)

There is exactly one way to travel between every pair of vertices by a path.

**Leaf** - A vertex with no children.

## 7.12 - Properties of trees

- There are $n-1$ edges in a P$_{n}$ graph. (traditional tree)
- There are $n+1$ edges in a P$_{n}$ graph. (star graph)
- In a star graph with $n$ vertices, there will be $n-1$ edges.
