# Lesson 2 - Key Concepts of Service Management

## 2.1 Value and Value Co-Creation

<u>**Value**</u>: The perceived benefits, usefulness, and importance of something.  
<u>**Value co-creation**</u>: When value is created **with** your customers, not **for** your customers. A bi-direction creation instead of a mono-direction.

## 2.2 Organizations, Service Providers, Service Consumers, and Other Stakeholders

<u>**Organization**</u>: A person or group with its own internal functions, and with its own set of responsibilities, authorities, and relationships necessary to achieve its objectives.  
<u>**Service Providers**</u>: A provider of service, can be either in the same organization or an outside organization. Most common example ITIL gives is the company's IT department.  
<u>**Service Customers/Consumers**</u>: Generic role/umbrella term for the others below:

- <u>**Customer**</u>: Person who defines the service requirements.
- <u>**User**</u>: Person who uses the service.
- <u>**Sponsor**</u>: Person who authorizes the budget.

## 2.3 Products, Services, and Service Relationships

<u>**Service**</u>: A means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes desireable to customers-without their having to manage cost and risk.

<u>List of organizational resources:</u>

- People
- Information
- Technology
- Value Streams
- Processes
- Suppliers
- Partners

<u>**Service Offering**</u>: A formal description of one or more services. It may include the following below:

- <u>**Goods**</u>: Consumer goods to be supplied, such as a smartphone.
- <u>**Access to resources**</u>: Access under licence to the consumer under agreed-upon terms, such as a mobile network.
- <u>**Service Actions**</u>: Actions to address needs of a particular consumer, such as technical support.

<u>**Service Relationships**</u>: A cooperation with the customer to provide service in order to co-create value. Can include the following:

- <u>**Service Provision**</u>: Activities that provide services such as supplying of goods, ensuring user access, or fulfillment of actions.
- <u>**Service Consumption**</u>: Activities that consume services such as the acquisition of goods, management of resources to use the service, and service actions performed by users.
- <u>**Service Relationship Management**</u>: A combination of the previous two.

## 2.4 More About Value, Outcome, Cost and Risk

<u>**Output**</u>: A in/tangible deliverable of an activity.  
<u>**Outcome**</u>: A result, as perceived by a stakeholder, that is enabled by one or more outputs.

An output of a software manufacturer is the code. The outcome might be a satisfied customer who has their needs met.

<u>**Cost**</u>: The amount of money spent on a specific activity/resource.

- <u>**Costs Removed**</u>: Value creation through removal, such as the software provided removes the need for the cost of staff.
- <u>**Costs Imposed**</u>: The cost of the service provided, such as the upfront price, need for staffing or training, and the upkeep cost.

<u>**Risk**</u>: A possible event that could cause harm or loss, or make the achievement of objectives more difficult.

- <u>**Risks Removed**</u>: yada yada...
- <u>**Risks Imposed**</u>: See above...

<u>**Utility**</u>: The functionality offered by a product/service to meet a particular need. Essentially, what the service does.  
<u>**Warranty**</u>: The assurance that a product/service meets agreed-upon requirements. Essentially, how the service performs.

# Lesson 3 - Four Dimensions of Service Management

## 3.1 Organizations and People

<u>**PESTLE analysis**</u>: A framework of external influencing factors represented by the acronym.

- **P**olitical
- **E**conomic
- **S**ocial
- **T**echnological
- **L**egal
- **E**nvironmental

<u>**Organizations and People Dimension**</u>: Includes roles and responsibilities, culture, structure, and staffing(people).

## 3.2 Information and Technology

<u>Examples:</u>

- Workflow management systems
- Knowledge bases
- Inventory systems
- Communications systems
- Analytic tools

Note: There is more here, but it's mostly common sense and I'm having a hard time figuring out what to put here without just paraphrasing 3 pages.

## 3.3 Partners and Suppliers

Includes the organization's relationships with other organizations. Also includes contracts/agreements between the organization and suppliers.

<u>**Factors that Influence User of Suppliers**</u>:

- <u>**Strategic Focus**</u>: What core competencies of third parties to focus on. (Factors like: self-sufficiency).
- <u>**Corporate Culture**</u>: How the supplier operates internally can be a factor.
- <u>**Resource Scarcity**</u>: If they are the only supplier with a resource, it's your only option.
- <u>**Cost Concerns**</u>: How much do they cost?
- <u>**Subject-Matter Expertise**</u>: How knowledgeable are they about the resource they are providing?
- <u>**External Constraints**</u>: Can include government regulations, industry codes of conduct, or legal constraints.
- <u>**Demand Patterns**</u>: How often will we need to rely on this supplier? Are they okay with that?

## 3.4 Value Streams and Processes

This is concerned with how an organization's various parts work and coordinate with each other.

<u>**Value Stream**</u>: A series of steps undertaken to create/deliver products/services.  
<u>**Process**</u>: A set of interrelated activities that transform inputs into outputs. Essentially, what is done to reach an objective.
