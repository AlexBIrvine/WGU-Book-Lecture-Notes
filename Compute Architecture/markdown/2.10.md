# 2.10 Fallacies and pitfalls

## **Pitfall #1 - Expecting the improvement of one aspect of a computer to increase overall performance by an amount proportional to the size of the improvement**

If a program has 3 parts that take equal time to run, and the overall program takes 90 seconds to run, reducing the runtime of part 1 by half only gives you an overall runtime of 75 seconds.

This is why _making the common case fast_ as discussed in 2.2 is crucial.

<u>**Amdahl's Law**</u>: The performance enhancement possible with a given improvement is limited by the amount that the improved feature is used.

## **Fallacy #2 - Computers at low utilization use little power**

Even Google's warehouse servers, which are made for low power consumption, use 33% of peak power under 10% CPU load.

## **Fallacy #3 - Designing for performance and designing for energy efficiency are unrelated goals**

As discussed in the previous sections, power and CPU speed are directly related.

## **Pitfall #4 - Using a subset of the performance equation as a performance metric**

It's better to use the full benchmark suite by SPEC than to only focus on one benchmark.

<u>**Million instructions per second (MIPS)**</u>: A measurement of program execution speed based on the number of millions of instructions. MIPS is computed as the instruction count divided by the product of the execution time and $10^6$.
