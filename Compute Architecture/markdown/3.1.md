# 3.1 Introduction

## Section terms:

<u>**Instruction set**</u>: The vocabulary of commands understood by a given architecture.  
<u>**Stored-program concept**</u>: The idea that instructions and data of many types can be stored in memory as numbers and thus be easy to change, leading to the stored-program computer.

## Notes:

Although each computer system uses a different set of instructions (x86 vs ARMv8 vs MIPS) they are similar to one another. It's more akin to learning region differences in language than a new language all together.

Instructions are held in memory like data is held in memory: with binary numbers.
