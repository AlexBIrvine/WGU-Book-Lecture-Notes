# 3.3 Operands of the computer hardware

<u>**Registers**</u>: Primitives used in hardware design that are also visible to the programmer when the computer is completed.

<u>**Word**</u>:A natural unit of access in a computer, usually a group of 32 bits.  
<u>**Doubleword**</u>: Another natural unit of access in a computer, usually a group of 64 bits.

### **Design Principle 2: Smaller is faster**

- With fewer registers, the clock frequency increases since it takes less time to go over the registers.

```(ARMv8)
LDUR X9, [X22, #2]      // Base value = X22 value
                        // #2         = offset
                        // LDUR will take the value from the memory at location base+offset, and store it in X9
```
