# 3.4 Signed and unsigned numbers

<u>**Binary digit**</u>: One of the two numbers in base 2, 0 or 1, that are the components of information.  
<u>**Least significant bit**</u>: The rightmost(or smallest) bit in an LEGv8 doubleword.  
<u>**Most significant bit**</u>: The leftmost(or largest) bit in an LEGv8 doubleword.

The LEGv8 doubleword is 64 bits long.  
The largest base ten number representable by 64 bits calculated = $2^{64} - 1$

<u>**Two's complement**</u>: A signed number representation where a leading 0 indicates a positive number and a leading 1 indicates a negative number.  
 The complement of a value is obtained by complementing each bit (0 → 1 or 1 → 0), and then adding one to the result.

All 0's represent ZERO.  
All 1's represent NEGATIVE ONE.

"In a two's complement representation, the magnitude of the largest negative value is one greater than the magnitude of the largest positive number"

<u>**Negation shortcut**</u>: Negating a number by inverting the bits and adding one.
