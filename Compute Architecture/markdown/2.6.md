# 2.6 Performance

## Big picture formula:

$$Time = Seconds/Program = \frac{Instructions}{Program} x \frac{Clock Cycles}{Instructions} x \frac{Seconds}{Clock Cycle} $$

## General terms:

<u>**Response/execution time**</u>: The total time required for the computer to complete a task.  
<u>**Throughput/bandwidth**</u>: The number of tasks completed per unit time.

<u>**CPU time**</u>: The actual time the CPU spends computing for a specific task.  
<u>**User CPU time**</u>: The CPU time spent in a program itself.  
<u>**System CPU time**</u>: The CPU time spent in the operating system performing tasks on behalf of the program.

<u>**Clock cycle**</u>: The time for one clock period, usually of the processor clock, which runs at a constant rate.  
<u>**Clock period**</u>: The length of each clock cycle.

<u>**Clock cycles per instruction (CPI)**</u>: Average number of clock cycles per instruction for a program fragment.  
<u>**Instruction count**</u>: The number of instructions executed by the program.
