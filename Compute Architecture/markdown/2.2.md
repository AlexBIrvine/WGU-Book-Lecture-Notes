# 2.2 Eight great ideas in computer architecture

## 1-Design for Moore's Law

Computer chips have been getting faster/better rapidly since the 1960's.  
By the time a project ends, computers will be much better than when a project started.

## 2-Use Abstraction to Simplify Design

Abstract low level concepts (like bit manipulation) into high level ideas/code.

## 3-Make the Common Case Fast

Don't optimize for the rare use case of the computer. Perform a use case study and optimize for the common case.

## 4-Performance via Parallelism

Run processess in parallel (instead of one at a time) where possible.

## 5-Performance via Pipelining

Make hardware & software have specific purposes, and link them together to perform a task.  
(Using pipes in unix)

## 6-Performance via Prediction

"It's better to ask for forgiveness then to ask for permission" ~Grace Hopper  
In other words, it's often better to guess and start working then wait for perfect information.

## 7-Hierarchy of Memories

Use different types of memory (CPU registers, RAM, tape storage) in conjuncture to achieve the "large, cheap AND fast".

## 8-Dependability via Redundancy

For parts that can fail (drives mostly, but all parts), create dependability by having redundant systems. If one fails, the backup will prevail.
