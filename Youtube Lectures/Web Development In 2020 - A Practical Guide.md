## Intro (00:00 - 2:40)

This will be the last year this person (claims) to do this guide since there is a slowdown of new technology.

Why you would want to learn to code:

1. Work for a company
2. Freelance / create your own business.
3. Become a consultant
4. Create an app / Saas to make money
5. Code as a hobby.

---

## Tools 1: The Necessities (2:45 - 7:10)

<u>**Computer & OS**</u>: (OS is preference).  
<u>**Text Editor/IDE**</u>: VS Code recommended. A compiled language (Java), IDE is preferred.  
<u>**Web Browser**</u>: Chrome/Firefox.  
<u>**Terminal**</u>: Bash is the default terminal for linux/Mac, great as well. Use gitbash for windows.  
<u>**Design(optional)**</u>: Adobe XD for web dev design.

---

## The Building Blocks (7:11 - 9:20)

HTML / CSS is what you will **NEED** to know first.  
Stick to HTML5.  
CSS Fundamentals (Clolors, fonts, positioning, **box model**, etc.)  
CSS Flexbox & grid.  
CSS Custome properties (came out 2018).  
CSS Transitions / Animations basics.

---

## Responsive Design (9:21 - 11:00)

Every project should look good on all devices.

- Viewport & Media Queries
- Fluid Widths (Rem units over px)
- Mobile first layout

---

## Custom Reusable CSS Components (11:01 - 12:26)

Create your own modular, reusable CSS components to use in your projects.  
This is replacing frameworks like Bootstrap.

<u>**Sass**</u>: CSS pre-processor that makes this practice easier. Still recommended in 2020.

---

## CSS Frameworks (Choose 1) (12:28 - 13:55)

Less popular than past years, but still relevelnt.

<u>**Bootstrap**</u>: Still most popular.  
<u>**Tailwind CSS**</u>: Different, gaining tracking this year. Uses utility classes to create your own.

---

## Vanilla JavaScript (13:55 - 16:30)

JS is the programming language of the browser.  
MASTER THIS BEFORE MOVING ONTO NODE/REACT.  
(Sidebar has a bunch of youtube video links)

- Fundamentals (Variables, data types, functions, etc.,)
- DOM (Document Object Model)
- JSON
- Fetch API
- Modern ES6

---

## Tools 2 (13:56 - 20:45)

<u>**Version Control**</u>: Git & Github.  
<u>**Browser Dev Tools**</u>: F12 to access. Console, network tab, etc.,  
<u>**VSCode Extensions**</u>: Live server, live Sass compiler, etc.,
<u>**Emmet**</u>: Writes fast HTML, built into VSCode. <-- MUST LEARN.  
<u>**NPM/Yarn**</u>: JS package manager.  
<u>**Axios**</u>: HTTP library, better than Fetch API.  
<u>**Webpack / Parcel**</u>: Bundles NPM packages to use on the browser.

---

## Basic Deployment (20:45 - 23:15)

How to get a website/app on the web.

<u>**Domain Registration**</u>: **Namecheap**, google domains, etc.,  
<u>**Managed Hosting**</u>: InMotion, Hostgator, Bluehost, etc.,  
<u>**Static Hosting**</u>: **Netlify**, Github Pages, etc.,  
<u>**SSL Certification**</u>: (Doesn't talk about)

---

## Basic Front End Developer (23:16 - 24:12)

You can consider yourself a basic front end developer when you can do the following:

- Build websites for individuals / small businesses.
- Create mobile friendly layouts.
- Create CSS animations.
- Work with a CSS framework.
- Add dynamic page functionality.
- Build small client side apps with JS.
- Comfortable with dev tools.

---

## Where to now? (Choose 1) (24:13 - 25:05)

Do you want to learn frontend JavaScript framework or go to server side?

(Many jobs are looking for the former)

---

## Front-End Framework (Choose 1) (25:10 - 27:14)

Frameworks allow you to build SPA with organized and interactive UIs.  
There are more, but these are where the jobs are.  
Try all 3 and go with the one that clicks with you.

<u>**React**</u>: Most popular | Fairly easy to learn.  
<u>**Vue**</u>: Gaining traction | easiest to learn.  
<u>**Angular**</u>: Used more in enterprise | steep learning curve.

---

## Svelte (27:15 - 28:35)

A JS compiler that produces vanilla JS. (Also readable).  
**Very new, don't learn INSTEAD of frameworks above**.  
Learn after framework.

---

## State Management (28:36 - 30:40)

For larger apps, 3rd party state managers may be needed.  
New trend is trying to use less of these state management libraries.

<u>**React**</u>: Redux.  
<u>**Vue**</u>: Vuex.  
<u>**Angular**</u>: NGRX.

---

## Server Side Rendering (30:41 - 33:05)

Render react & vue on server as opposed to client.  
NEXT (react) / NUXT (vue).

Why:

- **Better SEO**
- File System Routing
- Auto Code SPlitting
- Static Exporting
- CSS-in-JS

---

## Static Site Generators (33:06 - 35:06)

**Gatsby** (React) and Gridsome (Vue) are examples.  
These will generate static site instead of rendering on client.  
Creates very performance sites.

---

## TypeScript (35:07 - 37:05)

Superset of JS, allows static typing & latest features of ES javascript.  
Compiles down to JS.  
Allows tooling support with IntelliSense.

---

## Front-End Wizard (37:12 - 37:42)

You can consider yourself a "Front End Wizard" when you can do the following:

- Familiar with popular frontend framework.
- Build advanced front-end apps.
- Smooth front-end workflow.
- Interact with backend APIs.
- Manage application level state.
- Server side rendering.

---

## Server-Side Languages (Choose 1) (37:42 - 42:56)

You'll need to learn this to be backend/fullstack developer.

- **Node.js** (Recommended)
- Python
- PHP - Still good despite it being "cool to bash".
- C# - Really good, speaker will learn more in 2020. Claims he doesn't have a ton of C# experience.
- Ruby - Died down unfortunately, not nearly as popular these days.
- GoLang -
- Java - Oldschool, speaker isn't a fan. Mostly used in enterprise. Spring Framework.
- Rust - Mostly used with webassembly (WASM).

---

## Server-Side Framework (Choose 1) (42:57 - 47:45)

<u>**Node.js**</u>: **Express**, Koa, Adonis, Feather.js, Nest.js  
<u>**PHP**</u>: **Laravel**, Symfony, Slim  
<u>**Python**</u>: **Django**, **Flask**  
<u>**C#**</u>: **ASP.NET MVC**  
<u>**Java**</u>: **Spring MVC**, Grails  
<u>**Ruby**</u>: **Rails**, Sinatra  
<u>**Go**</u>: Revel, but you really don't need a framework.

---

## Database (Choose 1) (47:45 - 52:12)

A way to store data.  
Some stacks work better together than with other technologies. (Example, JS works greate with Mongo).  
GUI programs usually exist to manage DB.

<u>**Relational DB**</u>: **PostgreSQL**, MySQL, MS SQL

<u>**NoSQL**</u>: **MongoDB**, RethinkDB, CouchDB

- Considered faster than Relational for certain applications.
- Doesn't store in tables, instead stores in documents.
- More freedom than relational databases.

<u>**Cloud DB**</u>: **Firebase**, Azure Cloud DB, AWS

- Great for small applications.

<u>**Lightweight & Cache**</u>: Redis, SQLite, NeDB

- Great for very small apps.
- Also used for caching.

---

## GraphQL (52:12 - 53:41)

GraphQL is essentially a query langauge for API.

- Single endpoint to ask for only what you want.
- Simple syntax, similar to JSON.
- Fairly easy to implement.
- Apollo is a client to interact with GraphQL server.

---

## Content Management (53:41 - 55:20)

A CMS is used to add content to website.  
Used to allow clients to update their own content.

<u>**Traditional**</u>: Wordpress, Drupal, Keystone, Enduro  
<u>**Headless**</u>: Contentful, Prismic.io, Sanity, Strapi

---

## Deployment & DevOps (55:21 - 59:24)

<u>**SSH**</u>: Secure Shell  
<u>**Web Server Environment**</u>: **NGINX**, Apache  
<u>**App Hosting**</u>: **Linode**, **Heroku**, AWS, Azure, Now  
<u>**Virtualization**</u>: **Docker**, Vagrant

<u>**Testing**</u>: Unit, Functional, Integration, etc.,  
<u>**Other stuff**</u>: Load balancing, Monitoring, security, etc.,

---

## Full Stack Dev (59:25 - 59:53)

You can consider yourself a "fullstack rockstar" when you can:

- Build UI using whatever front-end technologies you choose.
- Comfortable in a server-side language.
- Setup dev environment.
- Build backend apps, APIs, microservices.
- Work with databases, SQL, ORMs.
- Deploy to production (SSH, Git, cloud, etc.,)

---

## Mobile Development (Choose 1) (59:53 - 1:01:44)

Cool technologies to build native mobile apps with web technolgies.

<u>**Flutter**</u>: SDK from Google to build native apps.  
<u>**React Native**</u>: Build native mobile apps using React.  
<u>**NativeScript**</u>: use JS, TS, Angular, Vue.  
<u>**Ionic**</u>: Hybrid mobile apps with JS.

- High Data Security
- High Performance
- Accessibility

Examples: VSCode, Postman, Discord

---

## JAMstack (1:04:25 - 1:06:11)

Javascript, APIs & Markup.  
New trend.

- No restriction on framework / library
- Websites are served as static HTML files generated from source files (Markdown) using static site generators like Gatsby
- High performance
- Cheaper & easy to scale
- Easy to host (Netlify)

---

## Serverless Architecture (1:06:11 - 1:07:26)

Server operations without actually needing a server.
