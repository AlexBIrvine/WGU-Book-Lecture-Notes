## 2.1 Prioritizing Bugs

## 2.2 Tracking Systems

Both 2.1 & 2.2 contain links to the video lectures. Please see that section for notes.

## 2.3 IT/QA Communications

Software developers and QA should work together to squash bugs.  
Each bug should have a bug report created for it that includes the following:  
- A description of the problem. 
- The browser/OS being used.  
- Steps to take to repeat the problem.  
- What was expected vs what actually happened.  
- Error messages with screenshots.
