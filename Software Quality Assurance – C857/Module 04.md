## The Psychology of Testing

We don't test to prove that the program works, we test to prove there are errors in the program.  
Negative reinforcements, remove the suck.  
(The rest of this section was restating that fact. It's okay to find errors, in fact it's good, etc.,)

## The Economics of Testing

The two most common types of testing are black-box testing & white-box testing:

<u>**Black-box Testing**</u>: Don't concern yourself with the inner workings of the program, instead focus if the inputs produce the desired outputs.  
Test data is driven purely from specification using this method.  
In order to find all errors using this method, you need to test every possible input (also known as _exhaustive input testing_).

<u>**White-box testing**</u>: Also called _logic-driven testing_, allows the tester to look at the internal working of the program and test based on the internal logic of the program.
