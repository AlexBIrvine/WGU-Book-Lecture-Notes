## 3.3 SonarQube

"SonarQube analyzes source code by using a combination of static and dynamic tools to measure code quality. Developers can use this tool to inspect their code base and identify a range of potential issues such as styling errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, code defects, design inefficiencies, or excess code complexity. Once identified, these quality concerns can be addressed."
